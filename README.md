# Work Day Scheduler
This task planner has time blocks for every hour of a common work day. each time block is color-coded depending on if the time is in the past, present, or in the future.
You can edit the task by clicking on the time block, then save it by clicking the save button to the right of it. A task will not save if the button is not clicked. Lastly, any saved task will load upon the page being loaded.
